# react-window-resize

Resize the browser window, as a React component.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install react-window-resize
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import WindowResize from 'react-window-resize'

const Example = () => (
  <WindowResize width={800} height={600}>
    When I'm mounted, the window size will be set to 800x600px.
  </WindowResize>
)
```

## API

### `<WindowResize [width] [height]>`

`width` and `height` default to the current window dimensions, so you can omit one if you only want to set the other.
